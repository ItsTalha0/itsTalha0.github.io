<h1>
	Simple guide for installing debian12  on qemu.
</h1>
<h2>
	Requirements:
</h2>
<ul>
	<li>

		Your machine should have atleast 8gb of ram.
	</li>
	<li>
		You should have an unix based operating system installed on your machines.

	</li>
	<li>

		Stable internet connection.
	</li>
	<li>

		qemu installed on your machine.
	</li>
</ul>

<em style="font-size: 1.2em;">
	(assuming you have qemu installed on your system if not refer to qemu-wiki here https://www.qemu.org/download/  )
</em>

<h3>
	step1:
</h3>	
Download the iso image from the debians server. <br>
<a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/">ISO</a>	
	<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> <em>Don't go for the images where there is a gui as they tend be bloated and 
		are slow to run on vm. instead chose the standard debian img without any gui.</em>
	
<h3>

	step2:
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Create a folder with any name you want here we are creating one with name deb: <br>
		(this is done in order keep everything together in one folder) <br>
		$mkdir deb <br>
		$cd deb

	</li>
	<li>
		Once you are in the folder make the virtual drive on which we will install debian.
		<br>$qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow 32g
		<ul>
			<li>
				here qemu-img is the utility provided by qemu to make virtual drives in qcow format which again is provided by qemu.
			</li>
			<li>
				'create' tell the utility to create a new disk img, 

			</li>
			<li>
				'-f' flag specifies the format of the disk image

			</li>
			<li>

				'qcow2' is the format name
			</li>
			<li>

				'disk.qcow' is the name we are giving to the disk
			</li>
			<li>

				'32G' will be  the  max size of the disk we are creating.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>

	step3:
</h3>
	run the command: <br>
	$qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -cdrom ../isos/debian-live-12.2.0-amd64-standard.iso -drive if=virtio,file=disk.qcow2,format=qcow2
	<ul>
		<li>

			'-m' flag tell the qemu to start with how much memory 
		</li>
		<li>

			'-smp' sets the number of cores to start with
		</li>
		<li>

			'-cdrom' selects the booting media or installing media in our the case the iso we downloaded earlier
		</li>
		<li>
			'-drive' selects the media or drive on where have to install the os.

		</li>
		<li>
			(press enter assuming you know how to install debian (installing debian is not as easy as just clicking buttons(it might be but anyways)))

		</li>
		<li>
			when you press return a new window will pop up with debians banner installation page.

		</li>
		<li>

			after you have successfully gone through all the steps of installing,
		</li>
	</ul>

<h3>
	step4:
</h3>
	To run your newly made vm run the command <br>
	$qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -drive if=virtio,file=disk.qcow2,format=qcow2 -netdev user,id=mynet0,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:7922-:22 -device virtio-net,netdev=mynet0 <br>
	this is the way you can run the newly created vm in gui format
	<br>
	<strong>
		<em>
		To run vm in headless form just add the flag '-display none -daemonize' to the command and you can
		acess the vm on port 7922 (assuming the guest os has a ssh server already running).
